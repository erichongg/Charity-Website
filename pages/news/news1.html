                        <strong>Rạch Dơi, or "Bat Creek,"</strong> is the Khmer name given to a community of stateless Vietnamese families living along the Mekong River in Cambodia. 
                        For more than fifty years—since the upheavals of the Khmer Rouge era—approximately six hundred families have made this stretch of water their home. 
                        Generation after generation has been born and raised on boats, relying on the river's resources and fragile, informal labor to survive.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="news-article-paragraph">
                        Life in Rạch Dơi is marked by poverty and uncertainty. Daily life revolves around fishing, low-paid construction work, and a small floating market; 
                        children often grow up with little access to schooling or safe places to play. Lacking recognized nationality or identity papers, 
                        these families remain invisible primarily to formal social services and legal protections, which deepens their vulnerability.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="news-article-paragraph">
                        In 2022, sixty-five families were evicted from the river by the Cambodian government. The eviction offered no meaningful assistance, leaving families 
                        to improvise and adapt to new living conditions. During this period of displacement, Father Tri Pham from the Diocese of Palm Beach and his 
                        St. Joseph Mission Charity worked alongside a group of religious Brothers in Rạch Dơi, stepping in to help. Through their efforts, 65 standard housing 
                        units were constructed for families from Rạch Dơi. About three months ago, many residents were able to move into their houses while longer-term solutions 
                        are pursued.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="news-article-paragraph">
                        The community's resourcefulness is evident in how families repurposed the materials of their former lives. Dismantled boats provided timber for cooking
                        fires and salvaged planks for cabinets, beds, chairs, and tables. From this necessity emerged an act of artistry and devotion: one family carved the 
                        bow of a boat into a striking statue of St. Joseph holding a small representation of the Vatican.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="news-article-paragraph news-article-quote">
                        "The choice of St. Joseph carries deep resonance. As patron of the Church, protector of families, and exemplar of humble labor, St. Joseph speaks directly
                        to a community in search of dignity, protection, and a sense of belonging."
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="news-article-paragraph">
                        The carved figure is both a religious icon and a reclaimed symbol of continuity—an everyday object transformed into a communal talisman that affirms hope in the face of statelessness.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="news-article-paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                        Rạch Dơi's story is at once one of material hardship and of human resilience. The struggle for legal recognition and fundamental rights continues, 
                        but the community's creativity, solidarity, and faith—embodied in acts like the carving of St. Joseph from a boat's bow—stand as a poignant testament to 
                        survival and the longing for a secure, recognized place in society.
