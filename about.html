                <h3 class="section-heading">Our History</h3>
                <p><strong>Friends of Lepers in Vietnam</strong>, legally known as the <strong>Tustin’s Friendship Association for Leprosy Inc</strong>, was established in 1994 by the Vietnamese congregation at St. Cecilia Church in Tustin, CA. We are an officially recognized 501(c)(3) charitable organization, dedicated to supporting individuals affected by leprosy in Vietnam. What started as a small group of churchgoers seeking ways to give back to the community quickly grew into an entire organization, with thousands of donors contributing countless funds to the wellbeing of lepers annually.</p>
                
                <h3 class="section-heading">Everything is for the Lepers</h3>
                <p>When our recently passed President, Công Văn Nguyễn, first set out to form our nonprofit, he had one very simple mission in mind: “Everything is for the Lepers.” Both during his lifetime contributions and our efforts to continue his legacy, we are dedicated to upholding this virtue. What does this mean? All contributions to our organization go to the lepers. Every single cent. Our volunteers, including our principle, operating, and administrative teams, contribute on a voluntary basis without receiving any form of monetary compensation. We take a hands-on approach to our aid, with volunteers individually financing trips to the Leprosy Villages in Vietnam every year.</p>
                
                <h3 class="section-heading">What is Leprosy?</h3>
                <p>Leprosy is an enduring infectious ailment instigated by Mycobacterium leprae bacteria. It primarily impacts the skin and peripheral nerves, potentially leading to lasting disabilities if not addressed. Transmission occurs through droplets from the nose and mouth in close, frequent contact with untreated cases. Fortunately, leprosy is treatable with multi-drug therapy (MDT). Cases of leprosy are documented across all six World Health Organization (WHO) Regions, with a significant number of new instances annually detected in South-East Asia. Especially due to the hot, humid climate of Indochina coupled with the impoverished conditions of the Leprosy Villages of Vietnam, Vietnamese individuals are especially susceptible to the harsh impacts of leprosy. Both leprosy’s prevalence in Vietnam and our organization’s ethnic ties to the region drive us to provide all we can to help these individuals who unfortunately cannot help themselves.</p>
